\chapter{Introduction}
This document is structured according to the IEEE standard 830-1998 Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.

\section{Vision}
 Provide unified bookkeeping experience for operations, run catalogue and management.
 
\section{Purpose of this Software Requirements Specifications}
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specifications document is to have a central point for all the requirements of the bookkeeping system. It is not written with the goal to have a document with definite and final requirements for this system. During the process of developing this system requirements will be added and modified.

\section{Scope of the Bookkeeping System}

\section{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}

\subsection{Log Entry}
A Log Entry is a text message that describe an intervention or an event that happened. It can be generated either by humans (e.g. a shifter enters his/her end-of-shift report) or by machines (e.g. a detector logs some abnormal situation automatically). 

\subsection{Run}
A Run is a unique ID that identifies a synchronous data processing session in the $O^2$ computing system with a specific and well-defined configuration. It normally ranges from a few minutes to tens of hours. It is generated and managed by the $O^2$ system. 

\subsection{LHC Fill}
An LHC Fill is a unique ID that identifies a period of activity in the LHC accelerator. It normally ranges from a few minutes to tens of hours. It is generated and managed by the LHC system and published via DIP protocol.
