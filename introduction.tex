\subsection{Log Entry}
A Log Entry is a text message that describe an intervention or an event that happened. It can be generated either by humans (e.g. a shifter enters his/her end-of-shift report) or by machines (e.g. a detector logs some abnormal situation automatically). 

\subsection{Run}
A Run is a unique ID that identifies a synchronous data processing session in the $O^2$ computing system with a specific and well-defined configuration. It normally ranges from a few minutes to tens of hours. It is generated and managed by the $O^2$ system. 

\subsection{LHC Fill}
An LHC Fill is a unique ID that identifies a period of activity in the LHC accelerator. It normally ranges from a few minutes to tens of hours. It is generated and managed by the LHC system and published via DIP protocol.
